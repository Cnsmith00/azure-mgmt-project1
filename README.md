# Azure Management Project
Azure project demonstrating VM deployment, RBAC, Key Vault, Policy enforcement, and cost monitoring in Azure.

# Azure Management Project (AZ-104 Aligned)

This project demonstrates core Azure administration skills including VM provisioning, RBAC configuration, secure key storage, policy enforcement, and cost monitoring. It follows a real-world use case aligned with AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator certification topics.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**Scenario:**  
A company needs a secure and cost-monitored Azure Virtual Machine (VM) deployment, with strong access control, enforced governance policies, and resource tagging inherited across services.

**Technologies Used:**
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Policy
- Azure RBAC / Entra ID
- Azure Cost Management
- RDP into Windows Server

---

## âœ… What I Did

- Deployed a Windows Server 2019 VM with NSG, static IP, and attached disk
- Created a Key Vault to store login credentials securely
- Assigned **Key Vault Administrator** role using Azure RBAC
- Enforced governance using **Azure Policy** with tag inheritance
- Set a monthly budget with email alerts using **Cost Management**
- Verified access by logging into the VM and inspecting Server Manager
- Tested policy enforcement by attempting to deploy a blocked resource
